\begin{frame}{My favorite plot from 850}
This is my favorite plot that I made in 850. It's my favorite because it was fun to make, and is super ugly.

<<graph,>>=
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data=penguins, aes(x = island, color = sex)) +
  geom_bar(position='dodge2', fill='light pink') + labs(title='Sex Count by Island', x='Island', y='Sex Count') + theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill='light pink'),
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color='black'),
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color='light blue'),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = 'light blue'),
    legend.position= 'bottom',
  ) + scale_color_manual(breaks=c('female', 'male', 'NA'), values=c('light blue', 'light grey', 'grey'))
